/*exmaple from RADsoft music wav's png's cross-fading alpha blending ect*/

Use this example for your intro's and cutsenes 

how to use it is easy look at how it works copy it

the  fading.h must be put in to your projects dir EG"your game" and then added in every file that uses the fading routine 

like this 

#include "fading.h"

.


have fun the example comes with images   when  buring you must have the intro dir on your cd to test this or it will not work change the image names when you change them to yours in the example source

you must have SDL_image SDL_mixer

so edit it out of the make file 

mod the make file to your system dir structor
